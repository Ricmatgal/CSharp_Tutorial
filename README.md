# CSharp_Tutorial

The solution **CSharp_Tutorial.sln** contains 3 projects:
- **BasicsProg (Console Application)** : learn what are primitive types, variables, string type, basic operations (=, +, -, ...), conditions (if, if/else, if/else if/else, switch), collections (Array/List/Dictionary), loops (for, foreach, while, do while), struct (copy mechanism) VS class (reference mechanism), methods, how to read/write to a file, good coding practices.
- **OOProg (Library)** : learn object-oriented programming using a simple example of a parent class and its children classes.
- **GameProg (Console Application)** : learn what does programming a game involve : user interface, user inputs, game logic, game loop.

## Guidelines
- Read the source code and all the comments as possible to understand everything.  
There are dozen of comments to help you understand the subtilities of the C# programming language.  
- Try to solve the exercises by yourself before looking at the corrections : give you at least 10 minutes to solve an exercise.  
- Executing and debugging the console applications step-by-step will also help you to understand how the code is processed.
