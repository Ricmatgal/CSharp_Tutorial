- **OOProg (Library)** : learn object-oriented programming using a simple example of a parent class and its children classes.
- **GameProg (Console Application)** : learn what does programming a game involve : user interface, user inputs, game logic, game loop.

Read the source code and all the comments as possible to understand everything.  
Executing and debugging the applications step-by-step will also help you to understand how the code is processed.
